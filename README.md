# Plant-State-Classification
Representing the machine learning model used for my graduation project. Given the biological and environmental data (soil moister, humidity, temperature, pH level) of a specific plant, the classification model is able to predict the state of the plant and classify the plant as either hydrated or dehydrated. The algorithm used is Logistic Regression, acheiving a score of 94% prediction accuracy. 

The dataset is gathered manually consisting of the four features (soil moister, humidity, temperature, pH level) and 24999 rows of readings gathered from four sensors each associated with a feature.
